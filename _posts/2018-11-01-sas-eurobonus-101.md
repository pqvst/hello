## Basics

### EuroBonus
EuroBonus is a Frequent Flyer Program (loyalty program) by SAS. As a EuroBonus member you earn points by flying with SAS and other partner airlines. You can also earn points by using a SAS branded credit card, booking cars, hotels, and more. You can then book flights using your points, which in general is very lucrative. Being a EuroBonus is *completely* free. There are no hidden costs. |Join EuroBonus](https://www.sas.se/en/eurobonus/)


### Star Alliance (*A)
SAS is a member of Star Alliance. This means you can earn points and book award flights using other airlines than just SAS. For example: Singapore Airlines, Thai, ANA, Lufthansa, Swiss, United, Air Canada, and more. For a full list of partners and terms refer to the partner [Earn](https://www.flysas.com/en/eurobonus/earn-points/){:target="_blank"} and [Spend](https://www.flysas.com/en/eurobonus/spend-points/){:target="_blank"} lists.


### Revenue / Award
In general, you can purchase flight tickets in two ways:
* Revenue - Flights booked using money (normal).
* Award - Flights booked using points.


### Travel Classes
With SAS there are 3 main [Travel Classes](https://www.flysas.com/en/fly-with-us/travel-classes/){:target="_blank"}:
* Go - Economy
* Plus - Premium Economy
* Business - Business


### Membership Levels
Your EuroBonus status determines the benefits you receive, such as upgrades, lounge access, business check-in, priority access, free luggage, point bonuses, and more. There are 4 main [Membership Levels](https://www.flysas.com/en/eurobonus/membership-levels/){:target="_blank"}:
* Member - EBB
* Silver - EBS
* Gold - EBG
* Diamond - EBD


## Points
There are 2 types of points:
* *Base Points* - Determine your membership level (cannot be "spent").
* *Extra Points* - Used to buy upgrades and book award flights.

There are 2 ways to earn points:
* Flying - Earns *Base Points* **AND** *Extra Points*
* Other - Earns **ONLY** *Extra Points* (with some exceptions).

> For example, a round-trip between Copenhagen and Tokyo in Go earns you 4.800 Base Points counting towards your next status level AND 4.800 Extra Points that you can spend as you wish.

Note that you do not earn any points for award flights.


### Qualification Period
You earn *Base Points* during your *Qualification Period* by flying. The *Qualification Period* is the 12 month period starting from the month that you signed up to EuroBonus.

> For example, if you sign up to EuroBonus on September 15, 2018 then your Qualification Period is September 1, 2018 to August 31, 2019. The next period after that will be September 1, 2019 to August 31, 2018 and so on...


### Base Points 
You earn *Base Points* by flying, and you always earn the same number of *Base Points* and *Extra Points* when flying. The number of points you earn depend on the destination and booking class. Typically the further you fly and the more you pay for your ticket the more you earn.

> A round-trip to London earns 200 to 4.000 points  
> A round-trip to New York earns 400 to 18.000 points  
> A round-trip to Tokyo earns 600 to 24.000 points

Your *Base Points* reset during the start of every *Qualification Period*. Therefore, your status is determined by how much you fly during each *Qualification Period*. Once you reach a new membership level you can keep earning more *Base Points* to reach an even higher level. Once you reach a new level you will keep that level for the current **AND** following *Qualification Period*.

> For example, your Qualification Period is September 1, 2018 to August 31, 2019.  
> You earn 45.000 Base Points by February 2019 and reach Gold status.  
> You will now keep Gold until August 31, 2020.  

Your *Base Points* never decrease until they reset at the end of your *Qualification Period* (they cannot be "spent") and spending *Extra Points* does not affect the number of *Base Points* that you have.


### Extra Points
You earn *Extra Points* by flying (see *Base Points* above), shopping in partner stores, renting cars, staying at hotels, or using a SAS branded credit card.

> 10.000 SEK spend with SAS MasterCard Premium earns 1.500 points  
> 10.000 SEK spend with SAS Amex Elite earns 2.000 points  

The best way to spend *Extra Points* is to book award flights with SAS or Star Alliance.

> A round-trip to London with SAS starts at 30.000 points  
> A round-trip to Tokyo in Go with SAS costs at 60.000 points  
> A round-trip to Tokyo in Business with SAS costs 100.000 points  
> A round-trip to Singapore Airlines in First Class cost 225.000 points

You can also spend your *Extra Points* by bidding for upgrades using *Plusgrade*. The more you bid (using money or points) the higher the chance is that you will receive an upgrade. Of course this also depends on how full the flight is.

Note that your *Extra Points* expire after 4 years if not used. However, if you are a EuroBonus Diamond member then your points never expire as long as you retain your membership level.


## Credit Cards
As shown above, credit cards are a great way to earn free *Extra Points* for every 100 kr that you spend. The number of points varies by card. There are also other benefits such as travel insurance, fraud protection, and award flight discounts (see *2-for-1 Vouchers* and *FlyPremium* below).

There are 2 main SAS branded credit card providers:
* SAS EuroBonus MasterCard
* SAS EuroBonus American Expres (Amex)

You can also earn points using the non-SAS branded Amex cards (such as Amex Gold or Amex Platinum). With these cards you earn Amex *Membership Rewards* instead. However, these can be converted to *SAS EuroBonus Extra Points*.
