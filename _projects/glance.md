Glance started out as an idea to create a unified "company dashboard", including various metrics such as Google Analytics, Social Media, and Stripe. Eventually we also developed a Slack bot (glancebot) that would integrate with your workspace to provide real-time metrics. After quite a bit of effort we eventually decided to shelf the project, but later ended up selling it to a new owner.
