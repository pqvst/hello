The easiest way to find and monitor award flight availability across multiple frequent flyer programs. It started as a project to solve my own challanges that I faced while trying to figure out the best way to spend my airline miles. Today it has 1000+ customers and supports several different frequent flyer programs, with more on the way. Be sure to check out the [blog](https://blog.awardfares.com/) as well.
