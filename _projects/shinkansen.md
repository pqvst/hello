While spending a lot of time in Tokyo I built a small tool to help me check seat availability on Shinkansen trains. During one trip to Japan I bought a 2 week rail pass and spent 2 weeks traveling all around Japan. I wanted a simple, quick, easy to use that let me regularly check seat availability on Shinkansen trains so that I could plan my (mostly last-minute) travel. JR offer their own tool (previously only in Japanese, but now available in English as well) called [JR Cyber Station](https://www.jr.cyberstation.ne.jp/index_en.html). My tool just makes it a little easier to refresh my past searches.
