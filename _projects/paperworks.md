All your receipts, invoices, and payments in one place. It was my first project built as a [One Week Build](/2016/09/28/one-week-build-paperworks-io/) and posted it on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/paperworks) where it became the #1 Product of the Day. Unfortunately the project is currently not accepting new users/customers due to [changes](https://paperworks.io/notice) that Google have imposed on API access to Gmail, which currently requires spending $15,000 to $75,000 for a security assessment.
