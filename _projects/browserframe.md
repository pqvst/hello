The easiest way to wrap screenshots in browser frames. Supports multiple browsers, operating systems, and themes. It was my second [One Week Build](/one-week-build-browserframe-com/) also shared on [Product Hunt](/posts/browser-frame) where it became the #3 Product of the Day. I use it myself all the time (even here to generate the project screenshots), and it gets a pretty decent amount of traffic.
